## Demo Code

<a href="https://inf133.markbaldw.in/resources/angular_demo.zip">Angular Demo Program</a>

The Angular demo project does not include the **`node_modules`** folder. So to successfully run the project after uncompressing it run:

```{code}
npm install
```

This will automatically install all required modules according to the **`package.json`** file included in the project. When install is complete, run:

```{code}
ng serve --open
```

This will launch the program and open it in a new browser window for you.
