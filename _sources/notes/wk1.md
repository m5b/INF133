### Assignment Lectures

#### HTML and Accessibility

I have broken this lecture into 6 parts. Most videos range from 9-15 minutes and focus on specific sections of the lecture. I have used the naming convention Lx-Px (_e.g.,_ Lecture 1 - Part 1) in the videos to help with flow.

### Thoughts on the Quiz

Overall, a good start. I know the questions went slowly for many of you, so we will try to move a little quicker in the future. Everyone performed well on the questions this week, so I don't have much more to add for this week. However, in the coming weeks, I will use this space to provide more feedback around some of the questions that I think need more explanation.
