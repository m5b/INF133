```{note}
The beginning of the lecture on device resources and sensors contains a correction for the way that I referenced local storage in Part 3 of the Databases and Local Storage lecture. Please review before attempting to make use of local storage! Additionally, you will find more detailed demo of local storage with Ionic in the bonus video below.
