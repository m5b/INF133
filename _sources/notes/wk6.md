### Live Setup and Debugging for A3

If you did not attend the live setup session for a3, and you are having trouble with getting your localhosts and Spotify connections working, you may want to watch this video. It's long and fairly boring, so I suggest skimming through the chat logs to see if you recognize any of the issues we discussed and then jumping to that point of the video.
