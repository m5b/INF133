## Lecture Materials

### Assignment Lectures


#### CSS and Responsive Design Part 1

I have broken this lecture into 5 parts. Most videos range from 7-17 minutes and focus on specific sections of the lecture. I have used the naming convention Px (_e.g.,_ Part 1) in the videos to help with flow.

Here are the slides and link to recording for the CSS lecture
