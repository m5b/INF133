User Interaction Software
============================

## Course Overview

Welcome to INF 133: User Interaction Software. Here you will find all learning materials for the course. Assignment descriptions, lecture notes, references, and other learning related information will be located here.

As we are virtual remote this quarter, we wanted to simplify access to learning materials for you. We are using the Jupyter Book format because it provides a rich format for sharing, viewing, and consuming technical information. In the upper right side of this website you will find a link that allows you to download the entire book in Markdown or PDF format. Feel free to use this feature if you need an offline copy of course materials. I will be updating this website frequently as we work our way through the class. So be sure to check back at least once a week. However, when major updates do occur, an announcement will be sent to the class mailing list.

### Course Description

From the catalog:

> Introduction to human-computer interaction programming. Emphasis on current tools, standards, methodologies for implementing effective interaction designs. Widget toolkits, Web interface programming, geo-spatial and map interfaces, mobile phone interfaces.
		
In practice, every instructor takes a slightly different bend to these topics. I focus on covering modern technologies for web and mobile development and how device capabilities can impact interface design and software architecture.
		
### Learning Objectives
		
At the end of this course, students should be able to:
		
* Program web applications in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which are sensitive to screen size and a person's abilities
* Leverage external data sources and APIs via asynchronous HTTP requests
Develop hybrid mobile applications which take advantage of on-device utilities
* Describe affordances of different screen modalities and input techniques
* Choose an appropriate web or mobile development framework for a given task
* Implement and articulate best practices for authentication, storage, and communication in web and mobile
														
### Required Text and Materials
														
Given the rapid changes in web and mobile development, any materials relying on a particular technology will quickly lose their value as a reference material. Articles online serve as a great resource, and all required materials will be made available. Check the resources section for some pointers, and feel free to send the course staff any resources you find useful as the course progresses.

### Assignments

Assignment details will be posted as the quarter progresses. When a new assignment overview page is posted, the corresponding assignment title below will be updated with a link to the assignment page. You will also see a link to the page appear in the navigation bar to the left.

**Assignments**:
* A0: Getting to Know You, Getting to Know Us 
* A1: Responsive Portfolio in HTML and CSS 
* A2: Runkeeper Tweet Report in JavaScript and TypeScript
* A3: Spotify Browser using a Web Framework 
* A4: Sleep Tracker 

### Exams

Due to the inherent difficulty of proctoring an exam remotely, for this quarter we will be replacing midterm and final exams with a course project. For the midterm you will be asked to write a short proposal that describes the project you intend to complete for the final. The final project must be built using a mixture of the tools and techniques you will learn throughout the quarter. This project will be the only partnered project allowed for the quarter. I will be providing more details about the final project in the coming weeks

### Participation

Although we are a virtual class this quarter, my goal is to reproduce as much of the classroom experience as possible. So we will be using an online quiz tool called Socrative throughout the quarter to keep track of our progress together and have a little fun. We will also have a course Slack workspace where we can chat and learn from each other.

Socrative quiz sessions will occur live during our regular meeting time every Tuesday. Each quiz will contain questions relating to course material, discussions, and your overall thoughts on the class. These quizzes are designed to be low-stakes and fun, but will also contribute to a participation grade for the class. The results of the quizzes will be posted here, shortly after they occur.

Slack will be our primary tool for communication. You will be expected to join the class workspace and participate in informal discussions during the quarter.

### Lecture Notes

As we move through each week, I will be adding notes from both my prerecorded lectures (available on Canvas) and discussions that we have with each other. New lecture note pages will be posted every Monday morning. The topics we will be discussing each week are listed in the next section. The content of these lectures is modeled closely after the version of INF 133 taught by Professor Daniel Epstein.
