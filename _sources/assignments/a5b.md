A5: Option B
============================

## Overview

We have frequently discussed how the concepts you have learned working with Angular and Ionic are transferable to other development frameworks. As an alternative option for A5, or the final project, you will be allowed to exercise your newly developed skills in web and mobile development by completing [A3](a3.md) or [A4](a4.md) using a different framework.

This assignment may be completed in pairs (exactly two students enrolled in the class) or individually. You may choose your own partner or use Zulip to help find one. There is no grade benefit or penalty to completing the assignment individually.

If you choose to pursue this option, you will be required to get approval from the course instructors. Submit your request as a DM in Zulip and copy all course staff and your partner (if you are working with someone). In your request, state which assignment you are going to reproduce and which framework you plan on using.

You will rely on the assignment details of your chosen assignment to complete your application. Your new framework must implement all of the requirements stated on the respective assignment page. 

#### Readme

Please update your readme.txt with how long the assignment took, who or what online resources you consulted with, any bonus features you added, and anything else we should know. If the assignment was completed in a pair, the readme should list names/emails/ids of both students. Only one submission needs to be made, however.

The readme for this assignment is critical as it provides you an opportunity to explain exactly where each of the requirements have been completed in your code. It is up to you to clearly document each feature. Failure to do so will risk not receiving points. A good rule of thumb is to document each requirement from the rubric followed by the names of the files that contain the code that support it.

Office hours are a great opportunity to get feedback on your design choices, and your assignment will be in part evaluated on how well they align with good principles of design. If you ran out of time or struggled to implement something, feel free to use the readme to describe what you intended to implement or what you struggled with.

#### Demo

Please record a demo video (demo.mp4 or a different file extension) which demonstrates all of the required features of your app. This video does not need to be polished. It is intended to help us understand the interface you have designed or developed and how it operates, but it's not intended to be a marketing pitch. Since you are making use of a webcam in this video, you might consider using your phone to record as you use gestures to control your app. We expect most videos can be 1 minute or less.

#### Submitting

To submit, zip your repository and upload it to Canvas. As with A3 and A4, your project might get quite large. Please remove all unnecessary files (e.g., node_modules) related to your development framework before zipping.
