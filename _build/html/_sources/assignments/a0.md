A0: Getting to Know You, Getting to Know Us
============================

Learning in a virtual remote setting makes getting to know each other quite challenging. So to facilitate our engagement with one another, your first assignment will be to introduce yourself in Slack. 

We have created an #introductions channel in our Slack workspace. So before our first live class on on Oct. 06, you must join the introductions channel and provide us with some fun and interesting facts about yourself. I have pinned a message in the channel with some ideas, but you are free to say as much or as little as you would like. However, at the very least, let everyone know your preferred name and pronouns and why you are interested in this course.

Once you have posted your introduction, take a screenshot, and upload it to the a0 assignment submission page on Canvas to receive credit.
