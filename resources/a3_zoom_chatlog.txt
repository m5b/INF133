09:52:06	 From  Jason Han : ^
09:52:22	 From  Ryan La : Yes please
09:52:35	 From  Tiffany Yujie Kong : should I be concerned about "gyp verb `which` failed" type statements when doing npm install on webserver?

09:54:21	 From  Alexis Ivan Padilla : I used to have that, but now the list is much shorter.

09:58:49	 From  Ryan La : I think a lot of ppl have issues on the client directory
10:01:29	 From  Mohra Arsala : Npm audit fix took away the errors
10:01:34	 From  Mohra Arsala : Just left with warnings now
10:02:19	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami   to   Mark S. Baldwin(Privately) : jk got it to work I think

10:06:08	 From  Brynn Suzanne Dunbeck : The npm audit fix took away the errors for me, but i'm left with a lot of warnings (windows)
10:06:17	 From  Jason Wang : Should we try launching the webserver or ng serve to see what a successful launch looks like? I was able to run ng serve fine even with all the errors so I'm not sure if all the errors actually affect it.
10:06:55	 From  Felix Pichetdara Khon : my errors say something about typescript

10:16:19	 From  Matthew Zhou : also do you run audit on both folders?
10:17:29	 From  Mohra Arsala : Running into issues with ng serve —open in client , whenever everyone else gets to that point
10:18:02	 From  Alexis Ivan Padilla : So all of that is fine?
10:18:24	 From  Justin Noah Yi : npm audit hasn't fixed any of my errors (windows_
10:18:42	 From  Mohra Arsala : Npm audit or npm audit fix?
10:18:48	 From  Justin Noah Yi : :o
10:19:48	 From  Justin Noah Yi : thank you Mohra!

10:25:40	 From  Ryan La : Did you see anything about localhost:8888
10:25:42	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : I should be okay after running npm audit fix no?

10:26:04	 From  Ryan La : Thanks!
10:26:24	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : oh ok yay!
10:26:46	 From  Tong Ge : yes
10:27:13	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : do I need to make those files before running npm install?
10:27:14	 From  Ryan La : Did ng serve --open do anything for you guys
10:27:19	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : i forgot to add them first Lo

10:31:19	 From  Ashley Teves : @ professor
10:31:28	 From  Jason Wang : I actually didn't get the text at the bottom, just the two lines of text ending with node ./bin/www
10:31:48	 From  Mohra Arsala : You have to go to localhost:8888 in your browser to get that text @jason
10:31:57	 From  Jason Wang : oh I see. Thank!
10:32:14	 From  Mohra Arsala : yeah
10:32:33	 From  Matthew Zhou : i don't have that issue i have a different one
10:33:16	 From  Alexis Ivan Padilla : That happens when you do audit fix. I reversed it and got a different set of errors.
10:33:29	 From  Matthew Zhou : did you create a file in the webserver already?
10:33:41	 From  Alexis Ivan Padilla : No
10:33:46	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : no
10:33:47	 From  Ryan La : @tianxiong I received the red text similar to him

10:34:13	 From  Tiffany Yujie Kong : even though i had the gyp errors 
10:34:15	 From  Ryan La : @Ashley did you do anything different to get the website to work?
10:34:17	 From  Jason Wang : I was able to launch and login (windows)
10:35:01	 From  Ashley Teves : Which part isnt working for u @ryan
10:35:07	 From  Ryan La : Ng serve
10:35:16	 From  Ryan La : In the client folder @ ashley

10:35:50	 From  Ashley Teves : Hmm I didnt see any errors when running the client folder
10:36:07	 From  Ashley Teves : And I didnt really make any changes
10:36:24	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : the same one prof baldwin has on his screen
10:37:47	 From  Ryan La : Hmmm, yeah im unsure. I also followed all the steps but im stuck where professor Baldwin is at currently @Ashley
10:38:52	 From  Tong Ge : how do you get out of the webserver/app.js:23:3 ?
10:39:04	 From  Justin Noah Yi : try cd ..
10:39:12	 From  Ashley Teves : Did u do audit to urs ryan
10:39:20	 From  Ryan La : Yeah I did
10:39:37	 From  Ashley Teves : Oh thats the part I didnt do Im thinking that prob made a diff
10:40:35	 From  Jason Wang : I also didn't run an audit fix on my client folder and ng serve worked fine
10:40:35	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : ^ahh you were able to run npm install with no error?
10:40:45	 From  Jason Wang : but I still have the errors
10:40:51	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : ohp
10:40:52	 From  Jason Wang : during the npm install
10:40:54	 From  Jason Wang : *
10:41:51	 From  Ryan La : I think I received error before and after running npm audit fix
10:42:25	 From  Juan Samuel Jr. Ramirez : when I run the webserver it reads webserver@0.0.0, assuming that’s incorrect? (Mac OS terminal)
10:42:44	 From  Ashley Teves : Thats what I see too
10:43:20	 From  Ryan La : Thats what I received for the web server @juan
10:44:33	 From  Mohra Arsala : I got it to work! Don’t do npm audit fix and ignore the gyp errors
10:45:11	 From  Archita Ganesh : yay!!
10:45:28	 From  Ryan La : How did you get it to work professor ?!
10:45:30	 From  Jaime Leal : I did npm install again on both web server and client but still couldn’t get it to work :/
10:45:34	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : so people who run audit fix should redo the install?
10:45:47	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : *ran
10:45:55	 From  Jason Wang : I think @Ashley mentioned it first
10:46:01	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : how do we reinstall it?
10:46:10	 From  Ryan La : Yeah do we reinstall?
10:46:10	 From  Ashley Teves : I actually am in gryffindoor aye
10:47:10	 From  Matthew Zhou : i have a syntax error and I am not sure why
10:47:29	 From  Matthew Zhou : in the routes folder
10:47:30	 From  Jaime Leal : Im just gonna reclone the repository again and not do npm audit fix tbh
10:47:36	 From  Matthew Zhou : it says I have an unexpected token
10:47:43	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : same Jaime
10:47:52	 From  Mohra Arsala : Yeah that’s what I did
10:47:54	 From  Ben Smith : How's it going professor :)
10:48:02	 From  Ben Smith : Yeah
10:48:07	 From  Ben Smith : I was teaching a lesson
10:48:23	 From  Avineesh Kompella : that's my co-worker :)
10:48:28	 From  Ben Smith : hi avi
10:48:31	 From  Avineesh Kompella : hi ben
10:48:54	 From  Matthew Zhou : in the webserver/routes/index
10:49:10	 From  Matthew Zhou : i just finished making the secret json and token json
10:49:14	 From  Matthew Zhou : and called npm start
10:49:22	 From  Matthew Zhou : yeah
10:49:28	 From  Matthew Zhou : nop
10:49:59	 From  Yuichi Okuhama : how do I reclone this again..?
10:50:00	 From  Ryan La : So don’t run npm audit fix on anything?
10:50:19	 From  Matthew Zhou : yes
10:50:22	 From  Ben Smith : oof
10:50:35	 From  Ben Smith : Windows with web dev makes npm so much harder :/
10:50:37	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : I just deleted the folder and redownloaded the GitHub folder
10:52:11	 From  Ben Smith : Oh yeah you are on windows
10:52:16	 From  Ben Smith : I didn't even realize that
10:52:25	 From  Brian Matthew Cantwell : this is why ICS45c and 46 use VMs
10:52:38	 From  Ben Smith : Are you using Windows Subsystem for Linux for installing stuff on Windows?
10:52:44	 From  Ben Smith : for npm etc
10:53:03	 From  Ben Smith : Gotcha yeah
10:53:12	 From  Ben Smith : Once WSL IS installed its much easier
10:53:24	 From  Ben Smith : but installing it is not so fun sometimes if you don't know your way around a terminal
10:54:04	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : so i should get a mac ? :D
10:54:20	 From  Ben Smith : If you have windows, I'd recommend installing Windows Subsystem for Linux
10:54:30	 From  Ben Smith : It's a bit weird to wrap your head around, but makes web dev SO much easier
10:54:58	 From  Ben Smith : I think doing web development on Windows is 100% doable if you use WSL
10:55:08	 From  Shreya Kapoor : Hi Professor, my client is compiling, but when clicking on login on the page, the localhost:8888/login shows up as an error. Is that normal?
10:55:32	 From  Jaime Leal : Got it working after recloning and not doing npm audit fix!
10:55:43	 From  Ryan La : IT WORKED
10:55:46	 From  Matthew Zhou : it seems I cant run it
10:55:52	 From  Matthew Zhou : even with the changes
10:55:59	 From  Matthew Zhou : yep
10:56:03	 From  Ryan La : But clicking login doesn’t work as well
10:56:06	 From  Shreya Kapoor : Which was the redirect? (sorry if that is a dumb q)
10:56:13	 From  Jaime Leal : My fans on my Mac are going crazy though lol
10:56:34	 From  Matthew Zhou : should I just delete my repository and reclone a new one without npm audit fix?
10:56:43	 From  Ben Smith : If you're running anything from npm @Jaime then yeah that's normal
10:57:01	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : mine doesn't look the same as the professor's, but the webpage at least loaded
10:57:01	 From  Ben Smith : My MacBook pro always spins up fans like crazy when I start a local server
10:57:20	 From  Ben Smith : @Chenyuan the styling will probably look slightly different, but should generally look somewhat similar
10:58:20	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : hmmm ok
10:58:31	 From  Ben Smith : Does it look at least somewhat similar?
10:58:35	 From  Ben Smith : Or does it look very different
10:58:35	 From  Jaime Leal : Probably depends on your browser?
10:58:38	 From  Tianxiong Wu   to   Mark S. Baldwin(Privately) : Is it normal that my local angular version is different from the global one?
10:58:50	 From  Ben Smith : Like is the content on the page the same, as in do you see all of the same text even if it looks different
10:59:01	 From  Shreya Kapoor : I did that part, should I maybe regenerate my client secret?
10:59:05	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : it has the look of when styling doesn't load if that makes sense
10:59:09	 From  Alexis Ivan Padilla : Nope still got the errors
10:59:10	 From  Ryan La : Still didn’t work with the login
10:59:12	 From  Ryan La : ^
10:59:20	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : it's just the html it looks like
10:59:31	 From  Ben Smith : Pop open your developer tools @Chenyuan
10:59:43	 From  Ben Smith : Should be CTRL-Shift-I or CMD-Option-I for windows or mac
10:59:54	 From  Ben Smith : Check the "Console" tab and see if there are any yellow warnings or red errors
11:00:48	 From  Tiffany Yujie Kong : thank you for the office hours today professor :))
11:01:11	 From  Chenyuan Zhang : oh it says bootstrap failed to load
11:01:16	 From  Ben Smith : There's your issue
11:01:34	 From  Ryan La : Wait are we suppose to update our client id and client secret in the .json file?
11:01:36	 From  Ben Smith : What's the exact error? you can PM me in zoom chat if you want
11:01:51	 From  Ben Smith : HACKED
11:01:54	 From  Jaime Leal : Prof can you show your localhost to compare?
11:04:03	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : should i be seeing anything after i run npm start?
11:04:08	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : im stuck on this screen
11:04:09	 From  Tyler Kento Matsunami : https://gyazo.com/d50236b45d57cb1305d7c32b7217e60f
11:04:15	 From  Jaime Leal : After you do that
11:04:20	 From  Jaime Leal : Run the client side command
